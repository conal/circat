**Circat** is a package for expressing computations in terms of `Category` and friends and then extracting circuits.
To visualize circuits, you'll need [Graphviz](http://graphviz.org) (or at least `dot`).

See the `Circat.Examples` module for examples.
For instance, run `outSimples` to construct some simple circuits, render them to PDF (easy to change), and display the results.

Dependencies:

*   The KU [netlist packages](https://github.com/ku-fpg/netlist)
*   [type-encode](https://github.com/conal/type-encode)
